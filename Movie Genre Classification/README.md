# Movie Genre Classification

Welcome to the Movie Genre Classification project repository! This solo project is part of my machine learning internship, where I aim to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, I explore the fascinating world of movie genre prediction.

## Project Overview

### Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the genre of a movie given its plot summary. By utilizing text-based features, I aim to unravel patterns and relationships within the textual information to make genre predictions.

### Techniques and Algorithms
- **Text Vectorization:** Utilizing techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings to convert plot summaries into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
- **Classification Algorithms:** Experimenting with various classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, to identify the most effective model for genre prediction.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib:** For data visualization and plotting.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For natural language processing tasks, including stopwords removal.
- **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library that includes tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `LogisticRegression` and `MultinomialNB`: For classification algorithms.
  - `TfidfVectorizer`: For text vectorization.
  - `accuracy_score` and `classification_report`: For model evaluation.
